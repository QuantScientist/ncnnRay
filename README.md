## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
**ncnnRay++** is a CMake based **integration** of **_raylib** (written in C) and the very popular 
**_Tencent ncnn_** deep learning library (C++).
 
**There is no OpenCV dependency for reading and writing images / videos or anything else**. Everything is self-contained using stb_image (part of raylib). 
The library includes conversion utils between ray Image, `ncnn::Mat` and PNG lib, all of which are interchangeable.
For more details, refer to: 
- https://github.com/QuantScientist/ncnnRay/blob/master/include/utils/vision_utils.hpp     
 
**Why??++** I am trying to integrate both into HTML using Webassembly. This would open the door to thousands of opportunities!.

# GPU or CPU?  
If you want to test on a CPU you will have to edit the CMakeLists file.
ncnn uses the Vulkan SDK for all its GPU operations. 

GPU (Vulkan) mode:
```cmake
set(NCNN_DEVICE "VULKAN")
```
CPU mode: 
```cmake
set(NCNN_DEVICE "cpu")
```
**Note**: Tested only on **GPU with CUDA 10.2 and a CPU on a Windows 10 machine**. 

## RayLib 
rayLib is an amazing library which has been widely adopted by the gaming community. 
Read more about the raylib game framework here: https://www.raylib.com/
Or look up projects using it here:
https://www.google.com/search?q=raylib+site:github.com   

## Tencent ncnn 
ncnn has a community that is growing by the day and compiles on almost every platform.

## A simple example 
The folowing example create a ray window, allocates a `ncnn::Mat` on the GPU and draws the value  into a ray window. 
 
```cpp

```

## Examples

#### A Simple example, mainly for testing the integration. Read an Image, allocate an ncnn tensor on the CPU.

## Requirements:
* Windows 10 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 16.4, Linux is not supported at the moment.
* NVIDIA CUDA 10.2 + Vulkan SDK . I did not test with any other CUDA version. 
* ncnn  
* 64 bit only.  
* CMake 3.18   
* RayLib GUI

# Building using CMake

## ncnn 
**CMake** should take care of everything for you!   
````bash
cd to 3rdparty\ncnn\
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
cmake.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "CodeBlocks - NMake Makefiles" . -B bin64 && cmake.exe --build bin64
````
CLion is strongly recommended for the build. Please setup CLion as follows: 
![ncnnRay++ Code](https://github.com/QuantScientist/ncnnRay/blob/master/asstes/clion.png?raw=true)
   
Then cd to the root folder of thie project and run again:
````bash
cd to the root folder
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
cmake.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "CodeBlocks - NMake Makefiles" . -B bin64 && cmake.exe --build bin64
````
## Downloading and installing steps rayLib:
The **CMake file will download this automatically for you**.
 
## Contributing

Feel free to report issues during build or execution. We also welcome suggestions to improve the performance of this application.

 - No tech support: this is merely a spare-time fun project for me.
 - Contribution is more than welcomed though.
 - Tested only on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019. More OS and dev env support are welcomed.
